## About

Connects to your **TP-Link Omada SDN** controller (cloud or local) through the **Omada Open API** and exposes your infrastructure, clients, and security data as Home Assistant entities — monitoring, control, and automation triggers included. See [Features](#features) for the full breakdown.

Cloud and traditional local controllers use **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials**
with automatic token refresh. Fusion gateways use their local web-interface
username and password instead.

---

## Features

Not every feature works on every setup — some need specific hardware:

| Feature | Platform(s) | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| Device status, CPU/memory, uptime, IP, daily traffic, firmware update/install | Sensor, Binary Sensor, Device Tracker, Button, Update | Any AP, switch, or gateway (install needs write access) |
| Wired client count, uplink device/port, link speed | Sensor | Device with confirmed wired ports (gateways always qualify) |
| Wireless client count, per-band stats, radio utilization, AP LED, SSID and radio-band controls | Sensor, Switch | Access Point (per-band sensors disabled by default; controls need write access) |
| Temperature, public IP, WAN rate/total/latency/loss, WAN status | Sensor, Binary Sensor | Gateway |
| VPN tunnel and peer/client connection status | Binary Sensor, Sensor | Gateway with site-to-site, VPN server, or VPN client tunnels; can be disabled in Options |
| WAN speed test | Button, Binary Sensor, Sensor | Fusion gateway with a WAN port; can be disabled in Options |
| Application (DPI) traffic | Sensor | Gateway with DPI enabled, plus clients/apps selected in Options |
| PoE budget/used/remaining, per-port power & switch | Sensor, Switch | PoE-capable switch (switch needs write access) |
| Site totals (clients, guest clients, PoE consumption) | Sensor | Any selected site |
| Site-wide SSID/LED controls and WLAN optimization | Switch, Button, Binary Sensor | Any site (controls need write access) |
| Threat heatmap (rolling hourly/daily/weekly/monthly) | Sensor | Controller with the Omada Threat Management API — not on the free cloud tier (see below); can be disabled in Options |
| Client sensors, presence, block/unblock, reconnect | Sensor, Binary Sensor, Device Tracker, Switch, Button | Selected client (RSSI/SNR/power-save are wireless-only; block/unblock and reconnect need write access) |

> **World heatmap card:** Threat heatmap sensors feed the companion [`ha-world-heatmap-card`](https://github.com/bullitt186/ha-world-heatmap-card), a generic Lovelace card for any sensor exposing this attribute shape. This integration is backend-only — install the card separately to visualize the data.

> **Free cloud accounts won't work.** Omada Cloud/Central **Essentials** has no Open API support — confirmed by TP-Link support. Cloud mode needs the paid **Standard** tier or higher; otherwise use **Local** with a self-hosted controller. See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#authentication-errors) for the resulting error.

> **OC200 Open API support depends on firmware.** Open API is confirmed to work on firmware 6.2.10.18, but earlier versions may not expose it. Update the controller and check **Settings > Platform Integration > Open API**. If that option is unavailable, use another supported controller such as the OC300 or the free Software Controller.

> **Permissions:** Control entities (PoE, LED, SSID and radio-band switches,
> device actions, client actions, and firmware install) need the corresponding
> Open API write permissions. The site-wide LED switch is omitted when its
> permission probe is denied; other controls may still be created because Omada
> permissions can differ by endpoint. Viewer-only credentials retain monitoring.

[![My Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=omada_open_api)

### Manual

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/bullitt186/ha-omada-open-api/releases) and copy the `omada_open_api` folder into your `custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration via **Settings → Devices & Services**

---

## Configuration

### Obtaining Credentials

#### For Cloud or Local controllers

1. Log in to the [TP-Link Omada Cloud Portal](https://omada.tplinkcloud.com) or your local controller's web UI
2. Go to **Settings → Platform Integration → OpenAPI**
3. Create an application to obtain your **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and note your **Omada ID** (controller ID)

#### For Fusion Gateways

No API credentials needed — use the same **username** and **password** you use to log in to the gateway's web interface. The Omada Controller ID is auto-detected during setup.

### Setup Flow

The integration guides you through a multi-step configuration:

**Cloud / Local controllers:**

1. **Controller type** — Select `Cloud` or `Local`
2. **Region** (cloud) or **API URL** (local, e.g. `https://192.168.1.100:8043`)
3. **Credentials** — Omada ID, Client ID, Client Secret
4. **Sites** — Select one or more sites to monitor
5. **Clients** *(optional)* — Optionally filter by SSID, then select clients for presence detection
6. **Applications** *(optional)* — Select DPI-tracked applications for traffic sensors

**Fusion Gateways:**

1. **Controller type** — Select `Fusion Gateway`
2. **Gateway URL + Credentials** — Enter the gateway URL (e.g. `https://192.168.1.1`), username, and password
3. **Sites** — Auto-selected (Fusion gateways have a single site)
4. **Clients** *(optional)* — Optionally filter by SSID, then select clients for presence detection
5. **Applications** *(optional)* — Select DPI-tracked applications for traffic sensors

### Installation Parameters

The following parameters are required during the initial setup flow:

| Parameter | Step | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Controller Type** | 1 – Controller type | Yes | `Cloud` (TP-Link cloud-hosted), `Local` (self-hosted controller), or `Fusion Gateway` (built-in controller). Determines the authentication method and API endpoint used. |
| **Region** | 2 – Region *(cloud only)* | Yes (cloud) | Cloud region where your controller is deployed: **United States**, **Europe**, or **Asia Pacific (Singapore)**. Sets the API base URL automatically. |
| **Controller URL** | 2 – Local URL *(local/fusion)* | Yes (local/fusion) | Full URL of your controller, including protocol and port (e.g., `https://192.168.1.100:8043` for local, `https://192.168.1.1` for Fusion). |
| **Verify TLS certificate** | 2 – Local URL *(local only)* | Yes | Controls HTTPS certificate validation for local controllers. Defaults to enabled for new setups. Disable it to connect to a hardware controller (e.g. OC200/OC300) that serves its factory self-signed certificate. |
| **Username** | 2 – Fusion credentials *(fusion only)* | Yes (fusion) | Web interface login username for the Fusion Gateway. |
| **Password** | 2 – Fusion credentials *(fusion only)* | Yes (fusion) | Web interface login password for the Fusion Gateway. |
| **Omada ID** | 3 – Credentials *(local/cloud)* | Yes (local/cloud) | The MSP ID or Customer ID from your Open API application. Found in **Settings → Platform Integration → Open API** in the Omada controller. |
| **Client ID** | 3 – Credentials *(local/cloud)* | Yes (local/cloud) | OAuth2 Client ID from your Open API application. Generated when creating a new application in the controller. |
| **Client Secret** | 3 – Credentials *(local/cloud)* | Yes (local/cloud) | OAuth2 Client Secret from your Open API application. Shown once when the application is created — copy and store it securely. |
| **Sites** | 4 – Site selection | Yes | One or more Omada sites to monitor. Fusion gateways with a single site are auto-selected. All devices and clients under the selected sites become available as Home Assistant entities. |
| **Clients** | 5 – Client selection | No | Network clients to track for presence detection and per-client metrics. The optional SSID filter narrows the wireless-client list while always retaining wired clients. Can be modified later via Options. Limited to the first 200 clients in the UI. |
| **Applications** | 6 – Application selection | No | DPI-tracked applications for per-client traffic monitoring (upload/download sensors). Requires DPI enabled on the gateway. Can be modified later via Options. |

**Network requirements:**
- Cloud: outbound HTTPS (443) to TP-Link cloud
- Local: network access to your controller's API port (typically 8043)
- Fusion: HTTPS access to the gateway's IP (port 443)

### TLS Certificate Verification

The **Verify TLS certificate** toggle appears on the local controller setup step
and in the reconfigure flow. It controls whether HTTPS connections to a local
controller validate the server's certificate.

- New setups default to **enabled** (verification on).
- Entries created before this setting existed keep verification **disabled**
  until you change it, so controllers with the factory self-signed certificate
  keep working after upgrading.
- Disable it for LAN-only hardware controllers (OC200/OC300) that serve the
  factory self-signed certificate.
- To keep verification enabled, install a certificate that Home Assistant
  trusts instead — see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#tls-certificate-verification-failed--self-signed-certificates).

Change the setting later via **Settings → Devices & Services → TP-Link Omada Open API → ⋮ → Reconfigure**.

VPN monitoring can be disabled under **Options → Gateway Entity Settings**.
Unsupported fields remain unavailable instead of being guessed from another VPN
type's schema.

### Per Client

### Per Site — Threat Heatmap

| Entity | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Sensor | `sensor.office_site_threat_heatmap_hourly` | Threat count, rolling last 60 minutes |

| Sensor | `sensor.office_site_threat_heatmap_monthly` | Threat count, rolling last 30 days |

One set of four per selected site. State is the raw threat count for a rolling window (relative to "now", never calendar-aligned). Attributes carry `source`, `site_id`, `site_name`, `window`, `window_start`/`window_end`, `total_rows`, `fetched_rows`, `skipped_rows`, `max`, and a `points` array (`lat`, `lon`, `country`, `value`, sample IPs, top signatures/activities, severities) — the shape [`ha-world-heatmap-card`](https://github.com/bullitt186/ha-world-heatmap-card) consumes. Disable under **Options → Site Entity Settings**; unsupported controllers just leave the sensors `unavailable`.

## Automation Examples

### Alert When an AP Goes Offline

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "AP offline alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.living_room_ap_status
        to: "off"
    action:
      - action: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Network Alert"
          message: "Living Room AP is offline!"
```

### Presence-Based Welcome Home

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Welcome home"

```

---

## Use Cases

- **Network dashboard** — device status, client counts, CPU/memory, PoE budgets at a glance
- **Presence detection** — trigger lights/locks/thermostat from device trackers
- **PoE scheduling** — power cameras/APs/phones down at night, back up in the morning
- **Firmware management** — get notified and install updates from HA
- **Bandwidth alerts** — flag a client or app exceeding a traffic threshold
- **Guest network automation** — toggle SSID broadcast by time, presence, or switch
- **Infrastructure health** — alert on sustained high CPU/memory for proactive maintenance

---

## Options

After initial setup, go to **Settings → Devices & Services → TP-Link Omada Open API → Configure** to access a menu with the following configuration options:

> **Verify TLS certificate** is stored alongside the other entry data rather
> than in this menu. Change it through **Reconfigure** — see
> [TLS Certificate Verification](#tls-certificate-verification).

### Client Selection

Add or remove tracked network clients. Selected clients receive device trackers
and per-client monitoring entities.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Filter by SSID** | Multi-select | Restricts the displayed wireless clients to selected SSIDs; wired clients always remain visible and clients hidden by the filter keep their existing selection. |
| **Clients to Track** | Multi-select | Select clients to create entities for. The UI shows at most 200 clients. |

### Application Selection

Add or remove tracked DPI applications for per-client traffic monitoring. Each selected application creates upload and download sensors for every tracked client.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Applications to Track** | Multi-select | List of DPI-tracked applications discovered on your network. Requires DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) to be enabled on your gateway. Traffic data resets daily at midnight. |

### Update Intervals

Configure how frequently each data type is polled from the Omada controller. Lower values give more responsive updates but increase API load.

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Device polling interval** | 60 s | 30 – 3600 s | How often infrastructure device data (APs, switches, gateways) is refreshed. Affects status, CPU, memory, uptime, PoE, and firmware sensors. |
| **Client polling interval** | 30 s | 30 – 3600 s | How often client data is refreshed. Affects device trackers, RSSI, SNR, traffic, and activity rate sensors. |
| **Application traffic polling interval** | 300 s | 30 – 3600 s | How often per-client application traffic data is refreshed. Higher values recommended since DPI data updates less frequently on the controller. |

### Device Tracker Settings

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Client disconnect timeout** | 0 min | 0 – 60 min | Keeps a tracked client `home` for a grace period after it disappears, avoiding false away events during brief Wi-Fi disconnects. Zero marks it away immediately. |

### Device Entity Settings

All categories default to enabled. Disabling a category prevents its entities
from being created.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| **Daily bandwidth sensors** | Device download/upload totals |
| **Client count sensors** | Per-device total, wired, wireless, guest, and per-band counts where supported |
| **Diagnostic sensors** | CPU, memory, uptime, IP, firmware, topology, temperature, and similar diagnostics |
| **Radio utilization sensors** | AP TX, RX, interference, and channel-busy sensors per supported band |

### Client Entity Settings

All categories default to enabled. Disabling a category prevents its entities
from being created.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| **Bandwidth sensors** | Downloaded/uploaded totals and RX/TX activity rates |
| **Signal sensors** | Signal strength, RSSI, and SNR |
| **Network access switch** | Client block/unblock control |
| **Reconnect button** | Wireless-client reconnect action |

### Site Entity Settings

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Threat heatmap sensors** | Enabled | Enables/disables the four threat heatmap sensors (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly) per site. Disable if your controller doesn't support the Omada Threat Management endpoint. |

### Gateway Entity Settings

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **VPN monitoring sensors** | Enabled | Creates one primary connection binary sensor for every site-to-site, VPN server, and VPN client tunnel. Tunnel peer/client telemetry is available as diagnostic entities. A VPN client exposes its own traffic, remote IP, and connection-time diagnostics rather than misleading peer counts. |
| **WAN speed test** | Enabled | Creates a **Run speed test** button, a **Speed test running** binary sensor, and diagnostic download, upload, latency, and last-test-result sensors for each WAN port supported by the gateway. Run the button from the device page or dashboard; the running entity is on while Omada reports the test in progress. |

Saving an option reloads the integration. Disabled VPN and WAN speed-test
features neither create entities nor poll their optional API endpoints.

---

## Supported Devices

All TP-Link Omada SDN devices accessible via the Open API are supported:

- **Controllers**: OC300, software controllers, cloud-managed controllers, and OC200 controllers running firmware that exposes Open API (confirmed on 6.2.10.18)
- **Fusion Gateways**: TP-Link Omada Fusion series (built-in controller, no separate hardware controller required)
- **Access Points**: EAP series (WiFi 5/6/6E/7, indoor & outdoor)
- **Switches**: JetStream and Smart Managed switches (PoE and non-PoE)
- **Gateways**: ER and SafeStream series
- **Clients**: Any device connected to the Omada network (wireless and wired)

> **Fusion + Traditional side by side**: You can add both a Fusion Gateway and a traditional Omada controller in the same Home Assistant instance — each as its own integration entry with independent authentication and polling.

Device availability depends on your controller's firmware version and API access level. See [Features](#features) for the OC200 and free-cloud-tier limitations.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Cloud dependency**: Cloud controllers require internet connectivity
- **DPI required**: Application traffic monitoring needs DPI enabled on the gateway
- **Local controller**: Requires Open API enabled (not available on all firmware versions)
- **Fusion Gateway**: Single-site only; no Open API app creation UI (uses web-session auth instead)
- **API rate limits**: Respected automatically; rarely an issue with default polling intervals
- **Viewer-only credentials**: Monitoring remains available, but controls require the matching endpoint permissions; only the site-wide LED switch has a setup-time permission probe

---

## Removing the Integration

**Settings → Devices & Services → TP-Link Omada Open API → ⋮ → Delete**, then confirm. This removes all entities and devices it created. To also clear config data/tokens, delete the `custom_components/omada_open_api` folder afterward.
